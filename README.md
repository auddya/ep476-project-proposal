## EP476: Introduction to Scientific Computing for Engineering Physics

Spring 2018

**Due: Tuesday, Feb 13, 1:00 PM**

# Project Proposals

Each student will submit a
[project](https://github.com/uw-ne/ep476/blob/master/proj/index.md) proposal,
from which we will select 2 or 3 group projects for as the basis for
collaborative development over the semester.

## Proposal Guidelines

Each proposal should describe:

1. a physics-based problem that can be solved computationally.

1. why you selected that problem.

1. the fidelity of solution that is desired for the scope of this project.

1. the strengths you will contribute to a team, particularly those you think
   are rare or unique

1. the pre-requisite knowledge for your team mates to be able to contribute to
   this problem

1. the criteria you would use to select other for your team, partiularly those
   you think will complement your own to round out your team

The proposal should be written in
[Github markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) in
full sentences/paragraphs.

## Submission Process

This submission process will rely on `git` and `github` as a way to test some
of your skills.

1. By visiting this repository you have claimed your fork of this repo

1. Clone the repo to your local filespace (at CAE or elsewhere)

1. Make a branch to start your proposal named `proposal`

1. create a new file and answer the first question above

1. add and commit that file

1. modify that file with an additional add, edit, commit cycle for each of
   questions 2 and 3

1. push your `proposal` branch to your github repository

1. create a pull request to request that `proposal` is merged into `master`

1. create a branch from the `proposal` branch named `team`

1. create a new file and answer question 4 above

1. add and commit that file

1. modify that file with an additional add, edit, commit cycle for each of
   questions 5 and 6

1. when complete, merge the `team` branch into the `proposal` branch

1. push this modified `proposal` branch to your repository

1. request a review from me in the pull request to complete the submission
