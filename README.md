# Project Proposals

Each student will submit a project proposal, from which we will select 2 or 3
group projects for as the basis for collaborative development over the
semester.

## Proposal Guidelines

Each proposal should describe:

1. a physics-based problem that can be solved computationally.

1. why you selected that problem.

1. the fidelity of solution that is desired for the scope of this project.

1. the strengths you will contribute to a team, particularly those you think
   are rare or unique

1. the criteria you would use to select other for your team, partiularly those
   you think will complement your own to round out your team
